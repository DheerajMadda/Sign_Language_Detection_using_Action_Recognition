# Sign_Language_Detection_using_Action_Recognition

This  project  aims  to recognize the  sign language from a 
sequence  of  frames  using  various landmarks such as face, hands, etc.
RNN  based  model  is  trained  over  these  landmarks. Custom  data  is
collected by capturing multiple images of different hand signs.
